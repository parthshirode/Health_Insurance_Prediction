Health Insurance Cost Prediction ü©∫üí∏
A simple and intuitive web application built with Streamlit to predict health insurance premiums. This project utilizes a Linear Regression model trained on a dataset of insurance beneficiaries. The trained model is saved using pickle for efficient loading and prediction within the app.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and simple UI for users to input their details.

Real-Time Predictions: Instantly get an estimated insurance cost based on the provided information.

Interactive Inputs: Sliders and select boxes for entering age, BMI, number of children, and other relevant factors.

Powered by Scikit-learn: Uses a trained Linear Regression model from the popular machine learning library.

Of course! Here is a well-structured README file content for your Health Insurance Prediction Streamlit web app. You can copy and paste this directly into a README.md file in your project's root directory.

How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
The core of this application is a machine learning model that has learned the relationship between a person's attributes and their insurance costs.

Model Training: A Linear Regression model was trained on a health insurance dataset to learn patterns and predict costs.

Model Serialization: The trained model was then serialized (saved to a file) using Python's pickle library. This creates a model.pkl file.

Streamlit Web App: The Streamlit application (app.py) loads this model.pkl file.

Prediction: When a user enters their details into the web form and clicks "Predict," the app feeds this information to the loaded model, which then calculates and displays the estimated insurance charge.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

Scikit-learn: For training the Linear Regression model.

Pickle: For serializing and de-serializing the trained model.

Streamlit: For building and running the interactive web application.

How to Run the App
Once the setup is complete, you can run the application with a single command:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
After running the command, your web browser should automatically open a new tab with the application running at http://localhost:8501.
